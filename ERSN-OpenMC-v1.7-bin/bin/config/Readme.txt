The config directory contains the following files to tell to openmc and ERSN-OPENMC softwares where to find paths:

0. this Readme.txt
1. cross_sections.dir     points to the full path of data/nndc/cross_sections.xml file
2. openmc.dir                                     of binary .../openmc/bin/openmc file
3. scripts.dir                                    of python .../openmc/scripts    folder

You could change manually the paths if you don't need to reinstall openmc code.
In the case of fresh installation of openmc the files are configured automaticaly.
